  <h1>Latent Dirichlet Allocation:</h1>
  <p>In natural language processing, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model that allows
    sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar. For
    example, if observations are words collected into documents, it posits that each document is a mixture of a small
    number of topics and that each word's presence is attributable to one of the document's topics. LDA is an example of
    a topic model. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation" target="_blank">-Wikipedia</a></p>
